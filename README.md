SIGNAL ACTUATOR CIRCUIT FOR CAPACITIVE GAS SENSOR

Under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Koushik Dutta

Successfully designed and implemented a signal actuator circuit for a capacitive gas sensor, providing accurate and reliable gas detection capabilities in a controlled environment.

Demonstrated expertise in circuit design and integration, ensuring seamless communication between the gas sensor and

The actuator triggers appropriate responses, such as alarms in the presence of alcohol or ketones.

Tools: Capacitive gas sensor, Microcontroller, ADC, DAC, Charge Amplifier, Opamp, Alarm System
